# Hamming Numbers

A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

Specifically:
```
The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 203050
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 213050
The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 203150
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 223050
The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 203051
The 20 smallest Hamming numbers are given in the Example test fixture.
```
Your code should be able to compute the first ( LC: , Clojure: , NASM, C, C++, Go and Rust: ) Hamming numbers without timing out.5 0004002 00013 282
